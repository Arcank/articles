Welcome to the 23rd issue of objc.io. This month is all about video.

Playing, recording and editing video happens a lot on the iPhone. It is amazing that a pocket-sized device allows us to do all this, and much more.

When dealing with video, there are many aspects that need to be considered. Adriaan writes about capturing video on iOS, and shows us a couple of different pipelines for video capturing. Daniel and Chris write about applying Core Image effects to live video from the camera or a static file. Finally, Carola and Felix write about Video Toolbox, a low-level framework that's very powerful, but relatively unknown.

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel and Florian.
